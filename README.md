# logiops

This is an unofficial driver for Logitech mice and keyboard.

This is currently only compatible with HID++ \>2.0 devices.

## Configuration
[Refer to the wiki for details.](https://github.com/PixlOne/logiops/wiki/Configuration)

You may also refer to [logid.example.cfg](./logid.example.cfg) for an example.

Default location for the configuration file is /etc/logid.cfg, but another can be specified using the `-c` flag.
